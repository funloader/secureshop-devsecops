# üß© DevSecOps Microservices Setup Recap

This document summarizes everything completed in your DevSecOps microservices setup ‚Äî from initial configuration to resolving key issues.

---

## üß© 1. Repository & SSH Setup

**Goal:** Set up a secure connection to GitHub and push your initial project.

### ‚úÖ What You Did Right

* Generated a new **SSH key** (`id_ed25519`).
* Added it to the **SSH agent** (`ssh-add`).
* Pushed to your GitHub repo successfully after fixing the permission issue.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Went Wrong

* Initially saw `Permission denied (publickey)` ‚Äî SSH key wasn‚Äôt added correctly.
* Fixed by starting the **ssh-agent**, adding the key, and confirming your remote configuration.

‚úÖ **Result:** Secure GitHub connection established and verified.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è 2. Project Structure

**Goal:** Create a clean, modular monorepo for SecureShop.

### ‚úÖ What You Did Right

* Created a professional folder structure:

  ```
  apps/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ product-service/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ order-service/
  infrastructure/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ helm/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ansible/
  pipelines/
  security/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configs/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ policies/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rules/
  docs/
  scripts/
  ```

* Added `.gitkeep` files to ensure Git tracks empty directories.

* Committed and pushed everything properly to GitHub.

‚úÖ **Result:** Repository organized like a real DevSecOps microservices project.

---

## üêç 3. Python Setup (Product Service)

**Goal:** Run the Flask-based `product-service` using SQLite.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Went Wrong

* `pip3` and `python3` were unrecognized ‚Äî Python wasn‚Äôt installed or aliases weren‚Äôt set.
* Fixed by **installing Python** and using `python -m pip install`.

### ‚úÖ What You Did Right

* Verified installation (`python --version`).
* Installed dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
* Ran the Flask app successfully.

Output:

```
‚úÖ Database initialized successfully
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

> Windows Firewall prompt confirmed local server access.

‚úÖ **Result:** Product service running and responding locally.

---

## üü© 4. Node.js Setup (Order Service)

**Goal:** Run the Node.js microservice.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Went Wrong

* `npm` not recognized ‚Äî PowerShell blocked scripts.
* Fixed by running:

  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  ```

  (and confirming ‚ÄúY‚Äù when prompted).

### ‚úÖ What You Did Right

* Installed dependencies with `npm install`.
* Ignored deprecated warnings (safe for development).
* Started and tested the app with:

  ```powershell
  curl http://localhost:3000
  ```

  Response:

  ```json
  {"service":"Order Service","status":"running","version":"1.0.0","timestamp":"..."}
  ```

‚úÖ **Result:** Order service running successfully via HTTP.

---

## üß† 5. PowerShell vs Linux Command Issue

**Goal:** Send a POST request to `/orders`.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Went Wrong

* PowerShell‚Äôs `curl` is an alias for `Invoke-WebRequest`, causing JSON flag errors.

### ‚úÖ What You Learned

Use:

* `Invoke-RestMethod` (native PowerShell)
* `curl.exe` (real cURL)
* or Postman / VS Code REST Client.

‚úÖ **Result:** You now know how to send JSON POST requests correctly on Windows.

| ---- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 1    | SSH GitHub | Permission denied      | Added key to ssh-agent         | ‚úÖ Push works              |
| 2    | Repo Setup | N/A                    | Created clean folder structure | ‚úÖ Professional layout     |
| 3    | Python     | Python not found       | Installed Python & pip         | ‚úÖ Product service running |
| 4    | Node.js    | npm blocked            | Changed execution policy       | ‚úÖ Order service running   |
| 5    | curl POST  | PowerShell alias issue | Used Invoke-RestMethod         | ‚úÖ JSON request success    |

---

## üéØ Final State

* ‚úÖ GitHub repo properly structured and pushed
* ‚úÖ Product Service (Flask) operational
* ‚úÖ Order Service (Node.js) operational
* ‚úÖ Environment ready for CI/CD, security scanning, and infrastructure automation

---

üí° **Next Step:** Add this recap to your `README.md` and optionally extend it with:

* Setup instructions for both services
* CI/CD and security notes
* Infrastructure provisioning steps (Terraform, Helm, Ansible)
